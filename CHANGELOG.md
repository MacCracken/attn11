## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- A from-scratch, dependency-free **GPT-style transformer that trains** in
  Cyrius — forward pass, hand-derived backprop, and Adam, all on raw `f64`
  arrays (no BLAS, no libc, no autodiff).
- `src/tensor.cyr` — f64-array helpers, deterministic PRNG (xorshift64 +
  splitmix seeding, Marsaglia-polar normal sampling), float printing.
- `src/ops.cyr` — linear, LayerNorm, GELU (tanh approx), softmax cross-entropy
  (forward + backward).
- `src/attn.cyr` — causal multi-head self-attention (forward + backward) over a
  single pre-allocated arena.
- `src/model.cyr` — packed parameter vector, token/positional embeddings,
  weight-tied LM head, full forward/backward wiring, Adam optimizer.
- `src/train.cyr` — char-level tokenizer, corpus, batch sampling, training
  loop, autoregressive generation (greedy + temperature sampling).
- `tests/attn11.tcyr` — 16 finite-difference gradient checks (every op,
  attention, and the full model); all passing.
- Architecture notes in `docs/architecture/tensors-and-floats.md`.
- Roadmap to v1.0 with versioned milestones and acceptance gates
  (`docs/development/roadmap.md`).
- CI/release process aligned to the patra/sigil model: lint warn-gate, DCE
  build + ELF verify, gradient-check suite, fuzz, benchmarks, security scan,
  and a docs/version-consistency gate; release builds the binary + source
  tarball + `SHA256SUMS`, extracts the changelog, and marks `0.x` prereleases.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `scripts/version-bump.sh`.

### Changed
- Toolchain pin `6.1.2` → `6.1.3`.
- `cyrius.cyml` package version now derives from `VERSION` via `${file:VERSION}`
  (VERSION is the single source of truth).
- Corpus is assembled from short segments at runtime (keeps src lint-clean
  under the 120-column gate).
